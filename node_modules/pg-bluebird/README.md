pg-bluebird module is designed to bring Promises/A+ ability to well known pg module. You can use it just like standard pg module with promise support instead of async callback functions.

Please see the example below.


## Example

```javascript
    var Pgb = require("pg-bluebird");

    var pgb = new Pgb();

    var cnn;

    pgb.connect("postgres://test:test@localhost/testdb")
        .then(function (connection) {

            cnn = connection;

            return cnn.client.query("SELECT * from table1");
        })
        .then(function (result) {

            console.log(result.rows);

            return cnn.client.query("SELECT * from table2");
        })
        .then(function (result) {

            console.log(result.rows);

            return cnn.client.query("SELECT * from table3");
        })
        .then(function (result) {

            console.log(result.rows);

            cnn.done();
        })
        .catch(function (error) {

            console.log(error);
        });
```
